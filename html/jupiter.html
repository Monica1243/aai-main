		<h1>Jupiter</h1>
		<p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system � more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.<br> Jupiter�s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).</p>
