		<h1>Uranus</h1>
		<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.<br> It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</p>
