		<h1>Venus</h1>
		<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth�s closest planetary neighbor. It�s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it�s often called Earth�s twin because it�s similar in size and density.<br>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it�s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It�s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.</p>
